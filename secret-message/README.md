Using array methods, you will transform an array of strings into a
secret message!

You should consult the <a

reference on any method with which you are not familiar.

1\.

Use an array method to remove the last string of the array
`secretMessage`.

2\.

Great! You can check your work by logging the `.length` of the array.

At this point, the length should be 1 less than the original length.

3\.

Use an array method to add the words `to` and `Program` as separate
strings to the end of the `secretMessage` array.

4\.

Change the word `easily` to the word `right` by accessing the index and
replacing it.

5\.

Use an array method to remove the first string of the array.

6\.

Use an array method to add the string `Programming` to the beginning of
the array.

7\.

Use an array method to remove the strings `get`, `right`, `the`,
`first`, `time,`, and replace them with the single string `know,`.

8\.

On one line, use `console.log()` and `.join()` to print the secret
message as a sentence.
